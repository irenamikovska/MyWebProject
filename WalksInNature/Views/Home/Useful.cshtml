        <span>Get the <strong>PSS mobile app</strong> on your phone! Many mobile phones have the ability to send the coordinates of their location. Make sure you know how to do it.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="lead text-center" style="color:black;font-size:20px">
        <span>If you have a serious problem, call for help on <strong>112 or 1470</strong> and send an SMS with your coordinates via the mobile application of PSS. Once you have connected to the PSS, keep your phone switched on and stay put. Do not make unnecessary calls to save phone battery!</span>
